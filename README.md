# Purpose
I want to create a terminal application that is able to give me a summary of my bank statements downloaded from monzo so I can see at a glance where my money is mostly going and coming. I also wish for it to store a history of previous months bank statements so I can track progress with spending habits to see If I am improving where I need to be or not to become more frugal.

I will be using python for this as it is the language I feel I can most quickly produce terminal applications with at the moment, may look to porting to go when I have learnt a bit more about the language.
